# Sashimono
Sashimono is the [daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)) which runs on all Evernode hosts, Sashimono manages the Hot Pocket smart contract instances running on each host. It handles all incoming hosting requests (redeems) and provisions Hot Pocket contract instances in secure silos using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.

Sashimono allows Hot Pocket maintainers to not need to configure each container to facilitate a smart contract instance, Sashimono manages **everything** for the node including creating an XRPL account, managing requests, managing smart contract instances and many more essential foundation of a Hot Pocket node. Sashimono is essentially the brain or a better term to use is the manager of the Hot Pocket node. Sashimono is what makes nodes so effiecient and easy to setup, without it, it would be a hassle for all the participating parties.
