Hot Pocket smart contracts Evernode uses Hot Pocket as its smart contract engine. Hot Pocket smart contracts are regular POSIX applications and can be written in any language. When multiple instances of a smart contract is deployed on a cluster of servers, Hot Pocket takes care of consensus and synchronization leaveing the smart contract developer to only worry about the contract application logic.
