| HOST_INVALID                                          | The host is not registered on the network. Try [selecting a different host](./host-selection.md) from the available host list generated using [`evdevkit list`](../evdevkit/overview.md#listing-active-hosts) command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

If you encounter this error repeatedly, consider acquiring from a host with a different xahaud node.<br><br>TRANSACTION_FAILURE (tecINSUFFICIENT_FUNDS) : This occurs when the tenant account has insufficient funds to cover the lease amount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| _Contract is uploaded successfully<br> but execution fails_ | Follow the below steps one by one to troubleshoot contract execution issues.<br>1\. Make sure your contract executes without any issues when deployed locally using HP-devkit. If any issues arise during the local execution, refer to the [HP-devkit troubleshooting guide](../../hotpocket/troubleshoot/troubleshoot.md).<br>2\. Re-check the validity of HotPocket override configuration values provided, if applicable.<br>3\. If this issue persists, try deploying on a [different host](./host-selection.md), preferably with better hardware resources. <br>4\. If you can connect to the host on which the contract is deployed, utilize the logs created at `/home/<contract_user>/<contract_name>/log/` to monitor the behavior of the contract. If you do not have access to the host, you may request the relevant logs by contacting the host via email. |

## Diagnosing Contract Execution-related issues using Read Requests and Contract User Inputs 

Contract Execution-related issues can be diagnosed based on its ability to receive [read requests](../../hotpocket/reference/client-protocol.md#read-request) and [user inputs](../../hotpocket/reference/client-protocol.md#user-inputs).

| Read requests | Contract user inputs | Contract state                                                            |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unreceived            | Unreceived              | Not successfully running.                                                  |
| Received            | Unreceived              | Contract successfully running, but not synced. (Has not reached consensus) |
| Received            | Received              | Contract is successfully running and is synced. (Has reached consensus)    |
