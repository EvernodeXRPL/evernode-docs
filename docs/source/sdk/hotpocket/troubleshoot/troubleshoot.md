| HotPocket usage limit failure.                                                                                                                              | Run the `hpdevkit clean` command. If that doesnâ€™t work, restart the `evernode/hpdevkit` docker container using either Docker Desktop or via the `docker restart <container>` command.                                     |
| Error response from daemon:<br> Container <docker_container_name> is not running.                                                                               | Run `docker start <docker_container_name>` to start the docker container and verify that the status of the relevant container is up using `docker ps -a`. You can also use Docker Desktop for this. |
| Error response from daemon:<br> Ports are not available | Using `docker rm -f <container>` command, remove relevant hpdevkit docker containers.                                                                                                                                 |

| Contract process execve() failed.                                                                                                                           | The `bin_path` variable defined in hp.cfg.override is invalid or does not contain the location of a valid application binary.                                                                                         |
| Contract process ended prematurely.

This will terminate the contract forcefully after the contract execution handler is completed, irrespective of any active listeners present.
| Error: Cannot find module <path>                                                                                                                            | 1\. The `bin_args` path defined in hp.cfg.overrride may be incorrect.<br>2\. Differences between Windows and Linux environments might cause this issue as well. In such case, try to use a Linux environment.             |
| HotPocket smart contracts must be executed via HotPocket.                                                                                                   | You cannot execute a HotPocket smart contract through the console. Specify the contract path using `bin_args` variable in hp.cfg.override and [run the DApp](../tutorials/basics.md#run-the-dapp)                                                         |
| Possible fork condition.  | This indicates a failure of cluster synchronization after deployment. Ensure that your contract logic maintains the same input, output and state in all the nodes. Consider [lowering the cluster size](../hpdevkit/overview.md#changing-the-cluster-size) to recreate and isolate the error. |
| Not enough peers proposing to perform consensus.                                                                                                            | This condition occurs before consensus is reached, typically at the initial consensus rounds. This should be a temporary stage. If it persists, check whether each node is operational.                                 |

Use an if-else condition to control logic executed in read only mode.                                                                                   |
