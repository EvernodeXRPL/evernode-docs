| HotPocket usage limit failure.                                                                                                                              | Run the `hpdevkit clean` command. If that doesnâ€™t work, restart the `evernode/hpdevkit` docker container using either Docker Desktop or via the `docker restart <container>` command.                                     |
| Error response from daemon:<br> Container <docker_container_name> is not running.                                                                               | Run `docker start <docker_container_name>` to start the docker container and verify that the status of the relevant container is up using `docker ps -a`. You can also use Docker Desktop for this. |
| Error response from daemon:<br> Ports are not available | Using `docker rm -f <container>` command, remove relevant hpdevkit docker containers.                                                                                                                                 |
| Cluster 'default' already exists.                                                                                                                           | Run the `hpdevkit clean` command.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Contract process execve() failed.                                                                                                                           | The `bin_path` variable defined in hp.cfg.override is invalid or does not contain the location of a valid application binary.                                                                                         |
| Contract process ended prematurely. Exit code 0                                                                                                             | This occurs as HotPocket logic uses a SIGINT termination signal, aimed at mitigating execution hangs. This error is negligible as it will not interfere with the smart contract execution process.                      |
| Error: Cannot find module <path>                                                                                                                            | 1\. The `bin_args` path defined in hp.cfg.overrride may be incorrect.<br>2\. Differences between Windows and Linux environments might cause this issue as well. In such case, try to use a Linux environment.             |
| HotPocket smart contracts must be executed via HotPocket.                                                                                                   | You cannot execute a HotPocket smart contract through the console. Specify the contract path using `bin_args` variable in hp.cfg.override and [run the DApp](../tutorials/basics.md#run-the-dapp)                                                         |
| Possible fork condition.                                                                                                                                    | This condition occurs due to large clusters. Consider lowering cluster size using HP_CLUSTER_SIZE                                                                                                                       |
| Not enough peers proposing to perform consensus.                                                                                                            | This condition occurs before consensus is reached, typically at the initial consensus rounds. This should be a temporary stage. If it persists, check whether each node is operational.                                 |
| Error: EACCES: permission denied                                                                                                                            | This occurs when a write command is executed in read only mode. Use an if-else condition to control logic executed in read only mode.                                                                                   |
