## Evernode beta

We are inviting interested enthusiasts to register as an Evernode host. As an Evernode beta host, your Linux server will be registered on the [XRPL Hooks v3 testnet](https://hooks-testnet-v3.xrpl-labs.com/). **Same rules and requirements as [mainnet](evernode-host.md) applies for the testnet hsost as well**

> **Testnet warning:** Since Evernode beta uses [XRPL Hooks v3 testnet](https://hooks-testnet-v3.xrpl-labs.com/), it is subjected to any changes/downtime imposed by the hooks testnet.
