# Overview

Sashimono is Evernode's host management software. It enables your host to participate in the Evernode network so that Tenants can lease smart contract hosting resources from your host. It performs the following jobs:
1. Interacts with Xahau for Evernode transactional activities.
2. Provisions HotPocket smart contract instances using the host's hardware resources.
3. Manages SSL certificates if you have opted-in for Let's Encrypt SSL integration.
